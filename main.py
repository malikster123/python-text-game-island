You have been walking endlessly for days, you do not remember you why you are on this journey, 
or what you are seeking for but feel compelled to see this to the end......

There is and end to this journey, you dont know what it is but something deep within tells you it exists...... 

whether it is a treasure or eternal happiness you do not know......

but it drives you forwards........

In the distance you see a castle, it is a tall intimidating structure, you can feel the aura from a distance, it invokes fear and at the same time intrigues you...

You see a path ahead, it looks rather long and strenuous but to your left to see a wooden booth with a sign that reads "FREE TELEPORTATION TO CASTLE".

you come across a warrior holding a massive sword. He is twice your size and looks like he wants to kill you. The door shuts behind and on the floor next to you lays a sword.... There is only one way forwards and you know what you must do, you have been training for a very long time but have always shied away from competition, you have made constant excuses but now there is no excuse. You must face him head on. You swing your sword and miss and the warrior cuts you. "Next time you die" he says. You realize you are still scared and hesitant, you finally muster the confidence to go in and attack with all your might and finally stab the the warrior directly into his heart. As he bleeds to death the world around begins the crumble and darkness surrounds you. You wake up back at your house and think "Was it all just a dream?" and return back to your normal life but this time with a sense of confidence. up until this point you lived a life of a coward, scared to make any real decisions and avoiding conflicts resulting in your current sitation. "I cannot live this life anymore i will no longer run away from struggle and challanges, i will face them head on regardless of how many times i lose"
